00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome to the advanced quantum computing seminar.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Today we'll discuss quantum entanglement.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Entanglement is what Einstein called "spooky action at a distance."

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
When two particles become entangled, they share information instantly.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This happens regardless of the distance between them.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's look at a practical example in quantum computing.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In a quantum processor, qubits can be entangled to perform complex calculations.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This property is fundamental to quantum advantage over classical computers.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Now, let's see how this applies to our quantum algorithm.
